# [Project Presentation](#project-presentation)

Project aimed to give real-world scenarios of manipulating the DOM. 

## [Project Summary](#project-summary)

The main goal of this project is to create a multi-section landing page. The leading functionality here is to be able to scroll to the appropriate section on the page when an element/item is clicked in the navbar. The use of JavaScript to create content, and interact with the elements is more than privileged.
